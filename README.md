# TextGenerator - Google's Gemini API Powered Text Generating Tool

The TextGenerator is a simple platform that integrates with Google's Gemini API to generate text from text-only input. This integration is inspired and facilitated by a guided tutorial project presented by JavaScript Mastery, developed using technologies such as React.js, Node.js, Express.js, and Vite.js.
